Workshop exercises for the Chain React 2024 Intermediate Workshop.

## How to use this repo

1. Fork the [companion repo](https://github.com/infinitered/cr-2024-intermediate-workshop-template). You'll start working right on `main`.
2. Start at the first module by opening up the file starting with "01-".
3. Do the rest of the modules in order.

## Prerequisites

- A local development environment ready for native iOS and Android React Native / Expo development, capable of running the `npx expo run:ios` and `npx expo run:android`, including recent versions of:
  - Xcode (version 15+)
  - Watchman
  - Cocoapods
  - JDK 17
  - Android Studio
  - iOS simulator
  - Android emulator
  - If you're not sure if you have all of these or if you have the right versions, check the [Expo Local App Development requirements](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/local-app-development/) for details on how to install these tools in order to enable local native development with the Expo CLI.
- Other general development tools:
  - Node 18.
  - Visual Studio Code
  - Git (Github Desktop works great)
- Hardware:
  - A Mac is highly recommended for the full experience.
    - The afternoon modules will have iOS-specific exercises. If a Mac isn't available to you, at least make sure your Android native setup is good. We may be able to help you make it through parts of the iOS exercises with EAS Build, provided you have an iOS device and paid Apple developer account.
- Yarn

## Test your setup before the workshop

Do these steps to ensure you'll be able to complete the workshop exercises.

1. Fork and clone the [template repo](https://github.com/infinitered/cr-2024-intermediate-workshop-template).

2. Restore dependencies with

```
yarn
```

3. Build and run the app on your iOS simulator:

```
npx expo run:ios
```

4. Build and run the app on your Android emulator:

```
npx expo run:android
```

If these steps don't work, refer to the [Expo Local Development guide](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/local-app-development/).

**Want to run on a device?** We will be focusing on emulator/simulator usage during the workshop, as it's especially easier for iOS. If you want to do some or all of the workshop on a device, you can also test with `npx expo run:ios --device` and/or `npx expo run:android --device`. Some later sections of the workshop may not work on an iOS device without additional configuration.
